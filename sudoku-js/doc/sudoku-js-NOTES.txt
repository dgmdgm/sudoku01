Notes on the JavsScript version of the Sudoku engine

TODO design
- See if StateChange is really necessary or it can be replaced with a CellState pointer to its predecessor.
- Consider having one CellCtrl per ui cell. Then $scope would hold what that cell needs. The problem is how to distinguish them and how to instantiate in the ng-repeat loops. The cell controller has to know which cell to connect to in the service.

TODO Coding
- JS portability to Mac and mobile
- Use Jsdoc

TODO Tuning
- suppress logs
 - commands to mute all
 - if(flag) to suppress expensive printing calls

TODO CM
- clean up git

TODO Build
- turn into proper webapp for deployment
